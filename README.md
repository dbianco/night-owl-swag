Enough people were into it that we decided this should actually happen, so we’re making it happen!

These shirts are up for presale until August 15th. All proceeds will be donated to [Black Girls Code][bgc].

Grab one while they’re still available to show your love for Sarah’s work _and_ support a great cause!
